        :param method: method for the new :class:`Request` object.
        :param url: URL for the new :class:`Request` object.
        :param params: (optional) Dictionary or bytes to be sent in the query
            string for the :class:`Request`.
        :param data: (optional) Dictionary, list of tuples, bytes, or file-like
            object to send in the body of the :class:`Request`.
        :param json: (optional) json to send in the body of the
            :class:`Request`.
        :param headers: (optional) Dictionary of HTTP Headers to send with the
            :class:`Request`.

            :class:`Request`.
        :param files: (optional) Dictionary of ``'filename': file-like-objects``
            for multipart encoding upload.
        :param auth: (optional) Auth tuple or callable to enable
            Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.
        :param timeout: (optional) How long to wait for the server to send
            data before giving up, as a float, or a :ref:`(connect timeout,
            read timeout) <timeouts>` tuple.
        :type timeout: float or tuple

        :param proxies: (optional) Dictionary mapping protocol or protocol and
            hostname to the URL of the proxy.
        :param stream: (optional) whether to immediately download the response
            content. Defaults to ``False``.
        :param verify: (optional) Either a boolean, in which case it controls whether we verify
            the server's TLS certificate, or a string, in which case it must be a path
            to a CA bundle to use. Defaults to ``True``. When set to
            ``False``, requests will accept any TLS certificate presented by
            the server, and will ignore hostname mismatches and/or expired
            certificates, which will make your application vulnerable to
            man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Setting verify to ``False``
            may be useful during local development or testing.
        :param cert: (optional) if String, path to ssl client cert file (.pem).
            If Tuple, ('cert', 'key') pair.
